<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
Apartment hunting is a huge hassle, especially in New York City. I searched far and wide for a good way to automate the apartment hunting process, but it seemed impossible. Many sites had ways to identify scripting and bots. Others that didn't had lacklust listings. Thus I bring you, RoboHouse. I wanted to create an apartment bot so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

-   You should be able to have access to apartments as soon as they come up. Why miss out when even waiting 3 hours could cost you your dream apartment?
-   You shouldn't have to accept that botting is impossible on many rental sites. Where there's a will, there's a way!
-   You should be able to fully customize your preferences and see notifications for new listings at all times.

Of course, this is an ambitious project, and your needs may be different from mine. So I will be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks!
